This is my personal changelog.
Ideas are from [this post](https://brianlovin.com/writing/make-a-personal-changelog) and [this post](https://nownownow.com/about).

Personal Changelogs are more stable than a social website feed and less permanent than the [about](/about) page.

You can view a less detailed changelog of me on [this page](https://www.polywork.com/harveyqiu).
